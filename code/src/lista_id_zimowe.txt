Who actually survived the apocalypse: revised
a) states that existed earlier and managed to use their wealth to survive in some critical area (say, ERE, Austria in Wien or Tirol)
b) random fortresses and cities that fended off the invasion (like Paris in original wotog)
c) totally random communities that had a fluke (like that peasant republic in North Germany)
d) my new fav, that is small to medium-sized islands (Gotland, Crete, Malta) that were taken over by pirates  and sailors from the ports of Europe fleeing for their lives (maybe Victual Brothers 2 even)

c)
A disaster called "postapocalyptic chaos" that's there, until it's fixed. Basically a bunch of events that make you choose between getting stuff done now and risking getting a bit rekt or
